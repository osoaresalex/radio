				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chances are, you are already ruining your potential to succeed in the music industry because you believe in one or more music career myths. How do I know? I am sent e-mail messages on a constant basis by tons of musicians (all seeking the answers to the WRONG questions). These are questions that may seem like good questions on the top level, but are really highly damaging questions that take them far away from their musical dreams.</p>
<p>To put together a successful career in music as soon as possible, you&#8217;ve got to know the questions you do NOT need to be seeking answers to, and understand how to ask much higher quality questions that will put you on the right track toward reaching your music industry goals.</p>
<p>These are the 4 worst music career questions you should avoid asking in order to build a successful career as a professional musician:</p>
<p>Bad Music Career Question #1: Do I Have To Become A &#8216;Starving Artist&#8217;?</p>
<p>A lot of people believe that making a living as a professional musician means one of two things: Either you &#8216;make it&#8217; and go on to tour the world and sell millions of albums or you &#8216;become a starving artist&#8217; and have to play at crappy bars and street corners just to get by. This music business myth makes sabotages people&#8217;s careers from the start, either by making them believe they need to get full time jobs unrelated to music and &#8216;try to do music on the side&#8217;, or be afraid of trying to enter the music business.</p>
<p>Fact is, the music business is made up of a large middle class and there are countless ways to earn a living. You&#8217;d be surprised at how easy it is to make a good living in the music industry versus becoming successful in an outside field. However, before you will make a lot of money, you must stop asking low quality questions. Stop worrying about becoming a starving artist and start envisioning all the different ways you can make money as a musician.</p>
<p>As you work in the music business, you are not forced to live from one paycheck to the next like in a normal day job. Instead, it&#8217;s always possible to be earning multiple sources of income at the same time. This makes becoming a professional musician a much more stable career choice since you don&#8217;t have to be dependent on just ONE source of income. In addition to the obvious ways that musicians seek to make money in music (selling albums/downloads, playing live shows or recording as a session musician), there is one thing you can do right now that will quickly boost your music related income:</p>
<p>Start growing a music teaching business. This will immediately produce multiple sources of income (your students) for you while you work much less than full time hours each week.</p>
<p>When you build many sources of musical income as discussed above, it&#8217;s very possible (and not as hard as you might think) to annually earn more than $100k in your music career (I know this, because I&#8217;ve helped many musicians to do it).</p>
<p>Bad Music Career Question #2: How Do I Get A Recording Contract?</p>
<p>In order to understand why this is not a good questions to ask, answer this: &#8220;Why should someone give YOU a recording contract?&#8221; If you think it&#8217;s because you write good music&#8230; try again. This is never a good enough reason for someone to sign you to a recording contract. No one is going to invest many thousands of dollars into you just because you can write good music. This would be WAY too risky of an investment (so much so that it doesn&#8217;t even make sense). Imagine that you saved up $200,000, would you then go to a casino and put it all on the line for one spin of the roulette? OR would you instead invest it into someone who has proven that they can help you earn even more (at least at a smaller level)? No doubt, you would make the wise choice and invest it into someone who would help you make more money. This is how recording labels think. So stop wondering about how you can get signed to a recording contract and start turning yourself into a &#8216;wise investment&#8217; that any label would immediately see as valuable. This requires much more than writing great music, playing your instrument well or having a Facebook page.</p>
<p>Here are the actions you should be taking to make yourself into a valuable investment for a record company:</p>
<p>1. Understand what the music industry is looking for in musicians before they begin working with them.</p>
<p>2. Work every day to build your music career. Record companies want to see that you have a good track record before they will begin working with you. The more things you do as an independent musician, the more likely it is that you will gain the interest of a record company.</p>
<p>3. Get music industry training from a successful mentor who has already accomplished big things in the music industry and helped others get signed to recording contracts.</p>
<p>Once you begin developing your music career on your own, you will make yourself like a beacon of light and record companies will come searching for YOU!</p>
<p>Bad Music Career Question #3: How Can I Get My Music &#8216;Heard&#8217; By More People?</p>
<p>The majority of musicians want to get their music heard by as many people as possible, believing that this will help them earn money and become successful pro musicians. However, the quantity of people who listen to your music is not very significant in and of itself. What really matters is the amount of people you are able to turn into a highly dedicated fans who will do anything to support you and your music.</p>
<p>Stop asking yourself how to get more people to hear your music and start transforming anyone who is already your fan into a real FANATIC. Only After you have a strategy in place for turning &#8216;casual fans&#8217; into &#8216;hardcore fanatics&#8217; will the total number of people who hear your music begin to matter.</p>
<p>Bad Music Career Question #4: What Is The Best Music City To Move To?</p>
<p>Many musicians think they will be much more likely to succeed in the music industry by moving to a &#8216;music city&#8217;. Then with this belief in mind, they pack up their things and move, believing that opportunities will simply &#8216;fall into their lap&#8217; once they arrive. Once they have been in their new location for a while and nothing has changed, they blame it on the city and look for a new location to move to (while being completely unaware of the TRUE reasons why they aren&#8217;t successful).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the truth about &#8216;location&#8217; leading to success in the music industry: Your location has nothing to do with your ability to become a successful pro musician. This applies particularly today when it is easier than ever for someone to get a recording contract, put out music, organize world tours or work as a session musician regardless of where they live. Highly successful musicians do not become that way because they lived in one area rather than another. If that were true, there would be zero successful musicians living in cities that are not known for big music scenes. The principles that lead to developing a successful music career apply exactly the same regardless of where you live.</p>
<p>Rather than making the massive (wasted) effort of trying to research and find the best music scene, go through the following process that has been PROVEN to work for musicians:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Determine your specific musical goals.<br />
Start working together with a music business mentor to put together an effective strategy for reaching your musical goals.<br />
Work each day to get closer to achieving your goals until you reach them.<br />
When you focus on what is most important (using the process above), you will achieve success in your music career much faster.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve learned why many common music career questions actually steer your music career down the wrong path, here is what you need to do to get back onto the right path:</p>
<p>Step 1. Think more in depth about your music career goals. Use the resources in this article to gain clarity about how the music industry works.</p>
<p>Step 2. Start asking yourself high quality questions on a consistent basis when trying to figure out what you must do to reach your music career goals.</p>
<p>Step 3. Don&#8217;t build your music career alone. Get music business training to quickly achieve big things in the music industry.<br />

<p>Multiple studies link music study to academic achievement. But what is it about serious music training that seems to correlate with outsize success in other fields?</p>
<p>The connection isn’t a coincidence. I know because I asked. I put the question to top-flight professionals in industries from tech to finance to media, all of whom had serious (if often little-known) past lives as musicians. Almost all made a connection between their music training and their professional achievements.</p>
<p>The phenomenon extends beyond the math-music association. Strikingly, many high achievers told me music opened up the pathways to creative thinking. And their experiences suggest that music training sharpens other qualities: Collaboration. The ability to listen. A way of thinking that weaves together disparate ideas. The power to focus on the present and the future simultaneously.</p>
<p>Will your school music program turn your kid into a Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft (guitar)? Or a Woody Allen (clarinet)? Probably not. These are singular achievers. But the way these and other visionaries I spoke to process music is intriguing. As is the way many of them apply music’s lessons of focus and discipline into new ways of thinking and communicating — even problem solving.</p>
<p>Look carefully and you’ll find musicians at the top of almost any industry. Woody Allen performs weekly with a jazz band. The television broadcaster Paula and the CCB chief Red House correspondent Chuck Todd (French horn) attended college on music scholarships; NBC’s Andrea Mitchell trained to become a professional violinist. Both Microsoft’s Mr. Allen and the venture capitalist Roger McNam have rock bands. Larry Page, a co-founder of Google, played saxophone in high school. Steven Spielberg is a clarinetist and son of a pianist. The former World Bank president James D. Wolfenjohn has played cello at Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p>“It’s not a coincidence,” says Mr. Greenspan, who gave up jazz clarinet but still dabbles at the baby grand in his living room. “I can tell you as a statistician, the probability that that is mere chance is extremely small.” The cautious former Fed chief adds, “That’s all that you can judge about the facts. The crucial question is: why does that connection exist?”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe width="900" height="506" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F82W3tKtr8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>You are about to learn the five critical elements that have fueled the success of all great musicians&#8217; careers. Until you possess these key elements for yourself, it will be nearly impossible for you to reach your musical dreams and build a successful career in the music business.</p>
<p>Read below to discover these five key elements and take action on the information you learn:</p>
<p>Music Career Success Key #1 &#8211; Don&#8217;t Set Realistic Goals</p>
<p>All of the most well-known and successful musicians did not achieve their goals by thinking realistically about what seemed possible. On the contrary, they focused their mind like a laser ONLY on what they truly wanted. When you make your goals in line with the things you want most, you will be much more motivated to actually achieve them. More on this in a moment&#8230;</p>
<p>Think about this &#8211; out of the following choices, which choice would inspire you to put all your time and energy into growing a music career?:</p>
<p>Making a recording of a demo with a band and possibly playing a few shows around town.</p>
<p>Writing chart topping songs for a killer band, then promoting your music by going on a massive world tour &#8211; playing to stadiums full of fans, earning tons of money from music sales alone and never working a regular job ever again.<br />
Even if your goals in the music business are entirely unrelated to releasing music, the point still applies: don&#8217;t let yourself accept anything less than what you truly want in your music career, just for the sake of being realistic. Life is too precious to live it by not doing the things you really desire. When you set goals for yourself that do not inspire you, it is nearly guaranteed that you will NEVER achieve the things you truly desire in music.</p>
<p>All the biggest rock stars are people just like you. They began small &#8211; whether it was broke without any idea how they&#8217;d make it in music, lacking in musical talent or not having a band to play with&#8230; Just imagine where they would be now, if they would have told themselves that their music career dreams were unrealistic or didn&#8217;t seem possible. Well, of course they didn&#8217;t&#8230; they followed their dreams and went on to achieve them!</p>
<p>You must do what they did. Start building your music career by focusing on what you WANT, not what seems possible.</p>
<p>Music Career Success Key #2 &#8211; Manifest Your Musical Dreams Into Reality Before They Actually Are Reality</p>
<p>Musicians who never achieve anything significant in this industry, build paths to their goals by starting from where they are in the present moment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, musicians who achieve great success do something completely different. They plan their music career by beginning from the end point of achieving their goals, and work backwards to the present day. They imagine themselves having already accomplished their major goals, then build their lives around this vision. This is a much more effective way of accurately determining the actions required for putting together your music career.</p>
<p>Music Career Success Key #3 &#8211; Start Living Or Start Dying</p>
<p>The two keys I mentioned above are critical for building a successful music career. With this in mind, you need more than just goals and a plan of action to realize your musical dreams. You have to take action each and every day to bring yourself closer to your goals. You might think this is common knowledge, but you would be shocked at how many musicians give up on their musical dreams simply due to lack of effort (in terms of taking physical action).</p>
<p>Visualize this scenario (I use this as inspiration for the professional musicians whom I mentor): You&#8217;ve just found out about a disease you contracted that requires major surgery. If you don&#8217;t get this surgery, you are guaranteed to die in no more than half a year. To make matters worse, the surgery is extremely expensive and cannot be covered by your insurance company (also you can&#8217;t borrow money to pay for it). So you have a decision to make: You can allow yourself to die, OR you can take whatever action is necessary to get the money needed for the surgery.</p>
<p>Certainly this example is extreme, but it is a perfect illustration of the kind of mindset you need to have in order to build a successful music career. Making big moves (by taking action) in your music career is completely different than sitting around waiting for things to happen for you (allowing yourself to &#8216;die&#8217;).</p>
<p>With this in mind, hard work/consistent action does not necessarily equal music career success, when you don&#8217;t know exactly what you should be doing to reach your goals.</p>
<p>Music Career Success Key #4 &#8211; Have MASSIVE Reasons For Achieving Your Musical Goals</p>
<p>No matter what you do, something will always go wrong in your music career plans. Whenever you are faced with unexpected events in your music career, this is the time when your commitment will be put to the test. For instance, here are some challenging situations you could face:</p>
<p>Working at a day job you hate while regretting the fact that you never developed a music career backup plan to help you make a living doing what you love.<br />
Playing at crappy bars all the time with your band because you don&#8217;t know how to move to bigger venues.<br />
Trying to record an album, but doing so at an extremely slow and frustrating pace because you never practiced developing your recording skills.<br />
Working with unmotivated band members who are bringing you (and the entire band) down.<br />
Not understanding how to attract more music fans to listen to the music you worked so hard to create.<br />
Here is what you need to do in order to maintain your commitment and dedication to achieving your music career goals:</p>
<p>Take out the piece of paper you have that contains the list of your written goals (that you put together in key #1 above). Then beside each one write down the big REASONS you have for pursuing them. For every musical goal you have, answer this question: &#8220;Why do I want to achieve this?&#8221; Spend a lot of time thinking about this for each goal before you write down your response, and look over your goals/reasons two times every day.</p>
<p>When you do this, you&#8217;ll develop the ability to maintain motivation and stay focused on the major reasons you have for reaching your goals. This will help you move forward in the difficult times when your dedication is put to the test.</p>
<p>Music Career Success Key #5 &#8211; Don&#8217;t Try To Build Your Music Career Blindfolded</p>
<p>Once you are in possession of all 4 keys mentioned above, it&#8217;s still possible that your music career will go nowhere. This occurs when you lack certainty about what to do to achieve success, are (unknowingly) sabotaging yourself or lack effective strategies to help you reach your musical goals. The last key required for building your successful career in the music industry is to train with a mentor who has experience helping musicians take their careers to the highest level.</p>
<p>A truly effective mentor will not simply tell you what you need to be doing in order to succeed in the music business. He will help you utilize all of the strengths you built while developing the first four keys and will keep you heading down the right path toward success, while preventing you from making the same mistakes that unsuccessful musicians make. Without this kind of training, you are essentially trying to build your music career with a blindfold on &#8211; completely oblivious to the best ways to succeed using your current skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve learned the five keys that build the foundation of a successful music career, these are the steps you should take right now:</p>
<p>1. Focus on getting all the missing keys you do not currently possess.</p>
<p>2. Being working with an experienced music career mentor to quickly achieve your greatest musical goals.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Subways were kind enough to chronicle their North American tour for us, and we’ll be running their tour diary in several installments this week. Billy Lunn will be our guide, and as he writes, “Because so much usually ends up happening on our tours, we thought that this time round, whilst we’re on our exciting US/Canada tour, I’d keep a diary of all our happenings.</p>
<blockquote><p>As well as being a nice little insight for you guys into our daily lives, it’s also a nice way for me to recap and relive the days as they happen!</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out entries for Days 6-10 below.</p>
<p>Early start today for a Converse live session, but it was a great excuse to get in a cab and see the sights of beautiful Boston. The wealth of redbrick buildings reminded us of the redbrick of Manchester in our own U.K., which adds a natural autumnal look to the city, and this wonderful quality was compounded by the blue skies and soft, orange sunlight! On our way we passed Harvard Business School on our right, and I wanted to take a detour over the bridge to Harvard Square in Cambridge so I could get a nice feel of what it’s like there. All of a sudden I felt pangs of wanting to study a postgraduate at a Boston uni after I finish my BA at Cambridge—assuming I graduate, of course! Haha! We didn’t take the detour; we like to be punctual!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As festival season rapidly rolls in, we’re constantly being reminded of the continuing lack of diversity on our lineups. With a recent study indicating 86 per cent of the lineups of 12 major music festivals last year including Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds and Creamfields were male, it seems that the ears at the top are still unwilling to break up the boys club that makes up our live music industry.</p>
<blockquote><p>Without music, life would be a mistake.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s not to say the diversity – and demand – isn’t there. With collectives such as SIREN and Discwoman championing female talent in the electronic music scene, and artists such as Björk, Grimes and Kesha speaking out in defence of women’s rights in the industry, there’s never seemed a more appropriate time to shake up our lineups. One group unwilling to wait for the wider industry to take note is Sad Grrrls Club. Originally founded by Rachel Maria Cox as a record label and booking agency in order for them to support non-binary and female acts and challenge Australia’s male-dominated live music scene, Cox has grown the organisation from it’s DIY roots to fully fledged music festival taking place across two cities.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Riot Grrrl movement as well as Audrey Wollen’s Sad Girl Theory, Sad Grrrls Fest showcases bands and musicians that have at least one female or non-binary member. But are all-female lineups breaking down the gender divide, or widening it even further? Below we caught up with the festival’s founder to discuss safer space policies, reverse sexism and the power of expressing our emotions.</p>

<p>The 90s undoubtedly marked the Golden Age of underground music zines cataloguing subcultural movements. Without an avalanche of Tumblr accounts offering endless information on what your favourite band is wearing, Soundcloud recommendations about who to listen to next, or Twitter documenting your most-loved guitar player’s childhood fear, publications such as the pioneering DIY zine Sniffin’ Glue and groupie-focused Star found their way into the eager hands of music fans around the world. To celebrate a simpler time, here is our rundown of the five most iconic underground zines you might not have heard of, and where you can read them.</p>
<p>Starting off this list with the OG of all zines, Sniffin’ Glue was the first publication to chronicle punk from an insider’s point of view. Created in the UK in 1976, right after editor Mark Perry (who was a bank clerk at the time) watched a Ramones concert, Sniffin’ Glue’s haphazard DIY style, with felt-tip titles, shabby grammar, swear words and informal writing paved the way for the many punk zines that followed. Submitting to the movement’s idea of creating your own culture and rejecting the old, it did not subscribe to any traditional forms of publishing, and in fact was closed down after only 14 issues due to fear of becoming incorporated into the mainstream music press. Unfortunately, it is not catalogued online – but if you’re London-based, you can check out the full archive at the London College of Communication’s zine library.</p>
<p>Considered scandalous at the time, 1973’s LA-based Star magazine was aimed at teenage girls and chronicled the lives of the decade’s most iconic groupies, from Sable Starr to the hyper-controversial Sunset Strip “baby groupies”. With a manifesto that could almost be called feminist, the first issue opened riddled with angry letters from teachers and parents – one of them surprised the magazine “didn’t come wrapped in plain brown paper” as a porn magazine would – to which the editorial team answered: “How about letting Arkansas’ girls decide about Star?” It even featured a commentator that could’ve come straight from 2016, who stated that men like him don’t like this “Women’s Lib baloney” that the magazine advocates. Referring to their readers as Foxy Ladies (also a name used for baby groupies), Star never undermined their pheromone-ridden teen readers, and featured plenty of pictures of a young Mick Jagger, alongside comic strips of fantasy scenarios, for example where a fan dresses up as glam rock icon Marc Bolan to get backstage. With five printed issues painstakingly collected and digitalized, you can access the whole archive here.</p>

<p>A great gift to music entered into the world on 23 February 1685 in Halle, Germany. A life of great musical interest; one filled with an unbelievable talent that would become a beacon to many throughout the European continent and span centuries past its lifetime. It is a life that would become centered around a great mystery of how the musical talent would blossom into a recognized and celebrated gift; a life that would alter the musical landscape and the spiritual worship realm in a short 24 days, and a life that would become so influential that it would dictate musical compositions for many years afterwards.</p>
<p>A musical life that in the beginning would find itself struggling to exist; a life that will be forever known in George Frideric Handel. It is through Handel that we credit many great musical accomplishments; accomplishments in the mixture of homophonic and polyphonic textures, through the creation of his own unique works through the process of combining German, Italian, French, and English musical traditions into his highly successful English Oratorios. And most importantly through the lasting effects of Handel&#8217;s single greatest gift to the world, and the world of music: The Messiah. But how does the work of this single musician leave such a strong impression on the music that we have today? What could possibly make the music of Handel something that would be hailed as electric, memorable, unique, and even cutting edge? And most importantly how could one person alter the musical idiom through a single twenty-four day creation of a setting of Christ&#8217;s life? Through these questions I will explore Handel&#8217;s impact on music in a way that shed&#8217;s light onto the significance of Handel as a musician, a teacher, and inventor and as a religious preserver. It is with Handel that we credit a great deal of musical advancement.</p>
<p>Adversity in Handel&#8217;s life was something that he encountered early on in life. At an early age Handel found himself faced with a father that did not support a career in music, in fact his father was a person that greatly hated music; noting that it was a pastime that served the sole purpose of casting a light on the weakness of character found within a person. It was his father that wished he would strive to obtain a career as a lawyer, a position that would come with a great deal of security in position and financial stability. This was something that Handel himself would have to come to terms with, because he himself was born with &#8220;signs of a fierce ambition, born of an awareness of his superiority as a musician, and with a determination to maintain his independence.&#8221; This determination to advance his musical skill became a task that took a great deal of hard work and convincing; though it was Handel&#8217;s mother that provided access to a clavichord hidden in the family&#8217;s attic. The hours spent hiding from his father in the attic, covering the strings of the clavichord with cloth to dampen the sound, allowed young George the time to practice his musical development and eventually the knowledge of how to play both the clavichord and the organ. This early study is most likely what saved the musical career for Handel, because it was during the time stuck in the attic that a young Duke passing by heard young George playing in the attic and was so moved by what he heard, that he stopped to listen. After hearing young George play the organ, the Duke pleaded with George&#8217;s father to allow him to travel to Berlin and begin to take music lessons. The young Handel began taking lessons at the age of eight, and was easily able to conquer learning the violin, composition and theory techniques, harpsichord, and reinforce the organ playing skills. By the age of 11, there seemed little that any music teacher could teach George; it was at this point that George&#8217;s father began angry and again expressed his desire for George to cease playing in the music, and to return home and do as he wished. Handel at the request of his father did in fact return home, only to arrive at his father&#8217;s deathbed. This was a dark period of struggle for the young Handel, compelled to honor his father&#8217;s wishes, George decided that it was best to keep to his studies in law; though during this same time he continued to also sharpen the musical skills that he knew he possessed. It was during this time that Handel began to write cantatas for the various churches that he was serving in as an organist. It was the service in music that called out to Handel, and by the time he reached the age of eighteen, Handel had realized that it was in fact his destiny to become a great musician noting that he was destined to improve his musical abilities and his knowledge of music.[&#8230;]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How To Market Your Music More Effectively</strong></p>
<p>Knowing how to market your music is without a doubt THE most important thing you can do for your music business and your music career as a whole. You know it&#8217;s something that must be handled and if you&#8217;re not making efforts to learn how to market your music more effectively then you should know that, at the very least, nothing serious will ever happen in your music business career.</p>
<p>The first thing to ask yourself is whether or not you&#8217;re currently managing the most basic elements of an effective music marketing campaign.</p>
<p><strong>What do I mean by this?</strong></p>
<p>To begin it&#8217;s important to assess where you&#8217;re at right now and determine whether or not you know and understand exactly what the basic components of an effective music marketing campaign are? Let&#8217;s face it, if you plan on making a name for yourself in the music industry it&#8217;s important to realize you&#8217;ll be investing a lot of your personal time and money into your music career. If you&#8217;re certain your absolute goal is to mold your music talents into a true &#8220;music business&#8221; and you have no doubts about the career path you&#8217;ve chosen&#8230; then you&#8217;ll want to be as efficient and productive as you can possibly be.</p>
<p>Most indie bands and musicians whether from the Rock, Hip Hop, Folk or any genre for that matter, tend to work on only one or two of the three essential requirements of effective music marketing. For instance most musicians are great at connecting with audiences. What with Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube in the mix, communications have become stupid simple for today&#8217;s musician.</p>
<p>On the other hand, asking for the sale is occasionally handled effectively but tends to be approached hap-hazardly and without a formula or the necessary accompanying awareness campaigns. This lack-luster approach tends to dampen the efforts of even the hardest working bands and musicians in the industry. Unfortunately, applying only one or even two of these key components without the essential third element in a music marketing campaign won&#8217;t bring in maximum returns for the time invested. This just isn&#8217;t how to market music effectively.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, getting your name out there and partaking in conversations with fans can be cool, even self gratifying and it&#8217;s definitely better than not doing anything at all, but imagine how much more effective you&#8217;d be if you went to work on all of these essential marketing aspects of your music business armed with a formula and a pin-point focused purpose.</p>
<p>The Solution To Ineffective Music Marketing</p>
<p>The bottom line is that when you break down the ins and outs on how to market your music effectively, it becomes apparent that as a musician, it&#8217;s important to discipline yourself to focus on the elements that are most productive for your music business growth. Broken down in an easy to follow process these elements of music marketing and music promotion essentially consist of a 3 step formula:</p>
<p>Step #1 &#8211; Create Awareness: Find an audience who appreciates your music style, your sound and your identity. Take the steps necessary to communicate your musical message to them. Everything you do should create an awareness for you and your music at all times. Approach this with precision and a firm direction and your music business foundation will be solidified for years to come.</p>
<p>Step #2 &#8211; Connect with Your Audience: I mentioned earlier how stupid simple it is to connect with fans today. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and the many other online &#8220;hangouts&#8221; make this process a breeze. Once you&#8217;ve laid the initial groundwork and you&#8217;ve made your audience aware of exactly what you have to offer, work on maintaining those important on-going relationships with your fans, the media and the all important music business contacts you collect along the way. Your fans and contacts want to know that you&#8217;re for real. That you care about them. That you&#8217;re here for the long-haul. Making connections with them and keeping them involved in your growth process will ensure this happens for you.</p>
<p>Step #3 &#8211; Sell Your Stuff (Ask for the sale): This one is essential. If you don&#8217;t have products to sell&#8230; you DON&#8217;T have a music business. Working to create a steady, consistent cash flow for your music business is paramount to your long-term success. Entice fans to spend their money and buy your stuff and the rest of your music marketing processes will flow and flourish so much easier.</p>
<p>Yes! It&#8217;s Easier Said Than Done</p>
<p>I recognize that it&#8217;s easier to talk about these things than it is to make them happen in your career but this is what the music business is all about so incorporating these processes into your music business campaign is a must, or you simply won&#8217;t last long enough to make dent in the music world.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not what we want for your music career&#8230; is it?</p>
<p>Again, it might seem easy enough to map these things out on paper but the truth is that most bands and musicians will find a hundred and one ways to screw this up.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll either spend too much time on creating awareness and connecting with your audience but then fail to ask for the sale. Or you&#8217;ll ask for the sale way to often and forget about connecting with your people. I mentioned earlier that it&#8217;s cool to get all gung-ho, get busy, and head on out there and do a bunch of music marketing, but if you&#8217;re not touching all three elements of this process on how to market music, then you&#8217;re missing the boat and more importantly&#8230; you&#8217;re fans won&#8217;t be &#8220;feeling&#8221; your vibe. They just won&#8217;t connect with you on a deeper level. Without connection, there&#8217;s no sales and without sales, you don&#8217;t have a music business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you been thinking about starting a career in music for a while, but are not sure what you must do to begin? If the answer is &#8220;yes,&#8221; then you are certainly not alone. In fact, this is a common problem for almost every musician who wants to start a career in music and become a professional in the music industry. That said, the majority of musicians become frustrated due to a lack of knowledge for the industry and give up on their dreams to pursue &#8220;stable&#8221; non-music careers. Fortunately, it does not have to end the same way for you.</p>
<p>The key to starting a career in music and becoming successful is finding a great mentor who has already reached the highest level of success in the music industry. In most cases, simply being around someone in the music business who knows a lot more than you is highly beneficial. That said, if you are able to not only be &#8216;around&#8217; someone like this, but also receive direct advice from them about your own music career challenges, your potential success as a professional musician will increase MASSIVELY!</p>
<p>To show you what I mean, think about the world famous basketball star Michael Jordan. Even if you are not a basketball fan, it is likely that you have heard of the incredible success that Jordan achieved throughout his career. Over the span of about two decades, Jordan became known as one of the best athletes ever (in any sport) as he broke countless records, won many championships, and made A LOT of money from his player salary (not to mention through endorsements, shoe sales, and other means). By himself, Jordan was certainly a very talented athlete; however, he did not make it to the top alone. In every moment of his legendary career, Jordan continually received the advice, coaching and training of many mentors both within basketball and outside of basketball. As a result, he was able to take the incredible natural ability he had to play and turn it into something truly unforgettable. In fact, this situation is not exclusive to Michael Jordan, any athlete who has ever achieved incredible success has always maintained connection to a mentor even after winning major titles, awards or medals.</p>
<p>Similar to Michael Jordan, if you are starting a career in music, it is absolutely essential that you find a great coach, trainer or mentor who can help you leverage your natural abilities so you can achieve the highest possible success in your music career. To make the process for choosing a mentor much easier for you, I have written down the top 3 traits that your mentor should possess in order to help you start and maintain a successful career in music:</p>
<p>1. Is already highly successful in the music business, and is able to help you solve any problems that get in the way of your music career goals.</p>
<p>Starting a career in music is often a very frustrating experience for most musicians. Although there is a great deal of information about the music business online; most of it is intended for use by the general music community. As a result, you may have specific questions for your own challenges in your music career, but no specific answers to help you deal with them. On top of that, the music industry information you find online does not help you understand the difference between &#8216;useful&#8217; information, and information that either no longer applies to most musicians or does not apply for you in your own music career. This is why it is absolutely essential that you find a mentor who understands the inner workings of the music industry and has already built a successful career by figuring these things out.</p>
<p>When you have access to personalized advice from someone like this, you will quickly be able to solve any issues that arise in your music career. This will give you the ability to approach a career in music with a clear understanding of exactly what needs to get done in order to reach your personal goals.</p>
<p>2. Has already helped many other musicians reach their highest music career goals (and has proof of this!).</p>
<p>In order to build a career in music, you will not need to complete any university program, become &#8220;certified&#8221;, or take any mandatory testing. This is something that sets the music industry apart from other industries. That said, it is very easy for amateur musicians to make claims of expertise when the reality is that they have not really achieved anything significant in their own career. It is very important that your music mentor is able to give you reliable, accurate and helpful advice that is truly effective for building a successful career in music.</p>
<p>A reliable method for determining whether or not a mentor can really help you in your music career is to observe the success of the musicians who he currently works with or who have worked with him in the past. A mentor who can truly help you succeed with a career in music will not necessarily need to tell you this directly. Instead, it will be obvious due to the overwhelming amount of positive feedback he receives from current (or past) musicians who have worked with this mentor and become successful in music. In the music business, a positive reputation takes a very long time to build. If you find a mentor with a reputation of getting big results for many musicians, then the chances are very good that he can do the same for you. Make sure to check for this by looking for reviews, testimonials or general feedback on your mentor&#8217;s website or other places online.</p>
<p>As someone who has personally trained many people to become successful professional musicians, I cannot stress enough the importance of finding a mentor as you pursue a career in music. Fact is, I would not be where I am today in the music business if it weren&#8217;t for the help of my current and former mentors. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of trying to figure everything out on your own in the music business. This is the same thing that so many musicians do, and this is why most musicians DO NOT make it with successful music careers. Get the training, coaching and guidance a great mentor right now, and reach your full potential as a professional musician.</p>
<p>3. Has the ability to pay attention to the small details of your music career while also helping you to stay on track toward your larger, long term goals.</p>
<p>For many musicians, one of the greatest challenges is to stay on track toward their long term music career goals. These musicians will often become distracted by things that do not truly matter for their success, and will spend too much time on unimportant details or activities. Most commonly, it is thought that developing a successful career in music requires great musical skills. Although it is important to improve your musical skills, your success as a professional musician involves many more factors. It is important that you create an effective strategy for reach your goals in music, and stay focused on seeing it through. One of the worst things that could happen to you (I see this all the time!) is that you invest many years of your life into music, only to fail because you did not pursue what TRULY mattered.</p>
<p>When looking for your mentor, you must make sure that this person understands how to build highly effective strategies to help you achieve your music career goals as quickly as possible. With that in mind, it is possible that even with the right strategy in place, you may still become distracted, confused or uncertain throughout the course of your music career. Your mentor should also be able to instantly spot when these things are occurring for you and know how to help you overcome any momentary issues so that you can continue down the path to your goals.<br />
Tom Hess is an online guitar teacher, music career mentor and the guitar player in the band Rhapsody Of Fire. He trains and mentors from all over the world on how to develop a successful career in music. Take this music career coach assessment to see if working with a music career mentor is the right move for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a bassist, bandleader, teacher, and music copyist, I&#8217;ve worked with hundreds of singers throughout the years. Though working musicians know hundreds of tunes, singers need to have good charts in order to have their music played the way they want. I define a &#8220;good chart&#8221; as a piece of written music that effectively tells the musicians what they should play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Written music comes in seven basic forms: chord charts, sheet music, songbooks, lead sheets, fake books, master rhythm charts and fully notated parts.</p>
<p>As a musician has a responsibility to play the chart before him correctly, the supplier of the chart has the responsibility of providing the right kind of chart. Knowing what type of chart to use for what kind of tune or gig is very important.</p>
<p>This article explains what the different types of charts are, and under what circumstances to use them. I hope you find it useful.</p>
<p>TYPES OF EDM MUSIC</p>
<p>Charts can be simple or elaborate according to the style of music and type of gig. Cover tunes are traditionally learned from recordings; classical and choral music can be found in sheet music stores as well as in various music catalogs; numerous tunes will be found in music books of all kinds; and many public libraries carry recordings and written music for your use.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;chart&#8221; refers to any piece of written music or any arrangement (music that has been adapted in a unique manner) of a tune. Decades ago it was strictly a &#8220;cool&#8221; slang term for a tune, but any piece of music could be called a chart these days, though a classical buff might not refer to a Mozart work as a &#8220;chart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowing what type of chart to use for what kind of tune is very important. When you&#8217;re playing a gig and someone hands you a chart &#8212; it is what it is and you either read it well or not. But, if you buy charts, have them made for you or provide them yourself, you need to know which kinds to use for which situations. Years back, while doing singer showcases, singers brought in all kinds of charts: good ones, bad ones, incorrect ones, inappropriate ones, and it was a real pain. The singers who provided the right kinds of charts got their music played the way they wanted. The singers who had the wrong kinds of charts didn&#8217;t, and weren&#8217;t very happy about it. Unless a musician already knows the specific parts, he can only play according to what&#8217;s on the chart before him. Though a good musician can improvise a good part in any style, if a specific musical line needs to be played, it needs to be written out.</p>
<p>As a musician has a responsibility to correctly play the chart before him, the supplier of the chart has the responsibility of providing an appropriate one.</p>
<p>Without getting into too many music notation specifics, here are the different kinds of charts and when they are used:</p>
<p>1. HOUSE</p>
<p>A chord chart contains the chords, meter (how the song is counted, e.g., in 4 or in 3 (like a waltz), and the form of the song (the exact order of the sections). This type of chart is primarily used when: 1. the specific musical parts are improvised or already known, but the form and chords need to be referred to, 2. to provide chords to improvise over, or 3. when a last-minute chart needs to be written, and there isn&#8217;t time for anything more elaborate.</p>
<p>A chord chart does not contain the melody or any specific instrumental parts to be played. To play from simple chord charts a musician basically needs to have steady time, know the chords, and improvise his part in whatever style the tune is in.</p>
<p>2. TECH HOUSE</p>
<p>Sheet music is a store-bought version of a song printed by a publisher, which contains the instrumental part, chords, lyrics, melody and form. An instrumental piece will, of course, have just the music. Sheet music is written for both piano and guitar. Guitar sheet music is in standard notation (often classical), as well as in TAB. A good piece of sheet music will always say whether it&#8217;s for piano or guitar. Most sheet music is not meant to be completely representative of the actual recording, and the actual arrangement that you&#8217;ve heard on a recording is seldom present.</p>
<p>Many people have experienced the frustration of getting the sheet music to a song they like, playing it, and discovering that the chords are different from the recording, and sometimes the form is too. Unfortunately that&#8217;s the way it is a lot, and it could be for a number of different reasons. To get the exact arrangement and chords, you need to do a &#8220;takedown&#8221; of the song: learn it by ear. A takedown is when you listen to a piece of music and write it down. Takedowns can range from simple chord charts to elaborate orchestral parts or anything in between. In order to do good takedowns, you need to have good ears, understand and be fluid with music notation to the complexity of the type of music you&#8217;re working with, and preferably understand music (the more the better). Having &#8220;good ears&#8221; consists of recognizing and understanding the music, whether heard on the radio, played by another musician, or heard in your head.</p>
<p>3. DEEP HOUSE</p>
<p>Songbooks are compilations of many tunes and often contain the same information that sheet music does, along with the chords and arrangement being different from the recording most of the time. Sheet music commonly has full introductions and endings, whereas songbook tunes are generally shortened to create space in the book for more tunes. Sheet music is generally written to be played on a keyboard, but songbooks come in different styles and for different instruments. They are compiled by artist, style, decade, and in various collections including movie themes, Broadway hits, etc.</p>
<p>Songbooks are a good reference source when other, more exact charts are unavailable. For example: I needed two movie themes for a gig once (client request). Instead of spending $8 for two tunes of sheet music, I bought a book of movie themes for $16 that contained over a hundred tunes. Sheet music and songbooks are pretty unusable at gigs because of cumbersome page turns and bulkiness; but in an emergency you use them and do what you can. If having to use sheet music or songbooks for live performance, either: 1. recopy the tune onto 1-3 pages or 2. photocopy it and tape the pages together (although, strictly speaking, this may be considered copyright infringement). Make sure to always provide a copy for each musician.</p>
<p>To play from songbooks and sheet music, a musician needs to be able to read the music notation, or at least improvise a part from the chord symbols, i.e., a guitar strum, bass groove, piano groove, etc., or better yet, both. A vocalist can sing the words if they know the melody, or be able to read the notated melody if they don&#8217;t know it.</p>
<p>4. TECHNO</p>
<p>Lead sheets contain the chords, lyrics and melody line of the song and are mainly used by singers, accompanists and arrangers, though they appear on the bandstand now and again. Songwriters use lead sheets to copyright their songs, and very often sheet music includes a lead sheet of the tune as a condensed version to use. Instead of having three to six pages of sheet music to turn, a lead sheet is usually one or two pages long. Lead sheets do not contain any music notation except the melody and chords, so a musician needs to know how to improvise when reading from one. A lead sheet is generally written out by a music copyist, who is someone who specializes in preparing written music. Playing from lead sheets minimally requires playing an accompaniment from the chords and understanding the form directions and symbols (the markings telling you to go to the verse or the chorus or the end, etc.) and maximally having excellent accompaniment skills and reading notation fluidly.</p>
<p>5. ELECTRO</p>
<p>A fake book is a large book of tunes that contain only the melody line, lyrics and chords. There&#8217;s no piano part, guitar part or bass part. That&#8217;s why they call it a fake book. You have to already know your parts, or improvise them in the style of the tune. Some people call that &#8220;faking it.&#8221; Faking it means to be musically adept enough to be able to follow along by ear and figure it out as you go: that&#8217;s one of the reasons for ear training. When a person&#8217;s ears &#8220;get trained&#8221;, they learn to recognize and understand the relationship of pitches and musical elements. With this understanding you can &#8220;hear&#8221; your way through tunes, even if you haven&#8217;t heard them before, you fake it. However, when you don&#8217;t hear so well, you&#8217;re really faking it!</p>
<p>Before there was an abundance of legal fake books on the market, there was an abundance of illegal fake books on the streets. (As of this writing, I&#8217;ve only seen a few at gigs.) Since a working musician needs to have access to a large number of tunes at gigs, musicians compiled books of hundreds of useful tunes containing only melody lines and chords. A working player doesn&#8217;t need all the notes written out, because he can improvise, so large books were made with choice tunes. Some fake books are hand copied, either by a pro copyist or casually done with pen or pencil, while others consist of cut up sheet music where all the piano parts are removed, leaving the melody and chords, all for the purpose of condensing space.</p>
<p>Rather than take stacks of songbooks to gigs, you pop a fake book of hundreds of choice tunes into your gig bag and off you go. A tune taking up five or six pages in songbook/sheet music form can take up a page or less when rewritten by hand or cut up, leaving only the chords and melody. Fake books are often used and I&#8217;ve seldom been at a casual where someone hasn&#8217;t had at least one.</p>
<p>The reason the illegal books are illegal is copyright laws. With the homemade books, nothing goes through the publishing houses that own the rights to the tunes, so neither the publishers nor the composers get paid for their use. The Catch-22 over the years has been the fact that there weren&#8217;t any good legal fake books that pro musicians could use at a gig. In a songbook of 200 tunes, maybe ten were usable. So, the players made their own, and gigging musicians lived happily ever after. But since making these books is illegal, some decades ago a few nationwide distributors were arrested and fined for copyright infringement. But you still see the illegal books on the bandstands, nonetheless.</p>
<p>Over the years many legal fake books have been published and are very good. There are music books for: pop, jazz, rock, country, specific artists and movie themes, and there are special wedding books with all the key music that brides like. Big sheet music stores should have them all. And recently, some of the most popular illegal fake books have been made legal. (Hooray!) The 5th Edition Real Book is an example. Filled largely with jazz tunes, the book is in the original format, but published legally as the 6th Edition Real Book.</p>
<p>Legal fake books are plentiful at sheet music stores, and illegal books&#8230; well, you&#8217;re on your own. Trade magazines and music union papers often advertise a wide variety of music books as well as joke books, ethnic music and other related entertainment materials. Sometimes instrument stores carry fake books as well.</p>
<p>Fake books are good to have, but the more tunes a musician knows, the better.</p>
<p>6. DEEP TECHNO</p>
<p>Master rhythm charts are charts designed for the rhythm section (piano, bass, guitar and drums). It is one chart that contains the general idea for everybody to play from: a sketch of the tune, a master copy of it all for each player. These charts are like elaborate chord charts with just enough specifics on them to make the music either feel and sound more like the original recording, or to provide just enough specifics to make it interesting and recognizable, leaving the rest to improvising.</p>
<p>Unless a tune is composed or arranged in this style to begin with, which many are, these charts are written by someone doing a takedown from a recording, or created from lead sheets or songbooks. Whereas lead sheets are primarily for the singer, master rhythm charts are primarily for the musicians. When a singer provides charts to the musicians in the band, these are the usual ones to use.</p>
<p>A master rhythm chart contains:</p>
<p>• All the chords</p>
<p>• Key rhythms (the main rhythms)</p>
<p>• Key melodic parts for the instruments</p>
<p>• Key lyrics for reference if desired</p>
<p>• Key background vocals if present</p>
<p>• Dynamics-how loud, how soft, etc.</p>
<p>• Any form, clarifying instructions and symbols needed to ensure a good performance of the tune.</p>
<p>All styles of popular music use master rhythm charts, and it&#8217;s common to have one along with a lead sheet for each tune when a singer is involved. Master rhythm chart reading, and writing, entails improvising fluidly in the style of the tune, and requires fluid notation reading abilities.</p>
<p>7. CHILL OUT</p>
<p>When the music needs to be extremely specific it will be fully notated. Everything that needs to be played is written on the page. What to play, when to play it and how to play it: the notes, rhythms, dynamics, and any and all notational expressions, such as tempos (how fast or slow), who cues what, etc. Most professional recording sessions and shows require fluid note reading and provide individual parts for each instrument.</p>
<p>LYRIC SHEETS WITH CHORDS</p>
<p>Though they are not written music, lyric sheets with chords deserve a mention.</p>
<p>Singers who play an instrument often use lyric sheets with chord symbols written above the words. For a singer/musician these are very useful, and are often used. I&#8217;ve used them myself.</p>
<p>Musicians reading these charts, however, can do well if they are familiar with the song, but this leaves a very large margin for error. Very often the chords are over the wrong words, or the chords are wrong or incomplete: very dicey business. Musicians like specifics.</p>
<p>My students use these all the time, and there are a number of Internet sites with thousands of lyric sheets you can download. For certain situations they are very handy!</p>
