<p>Multiple studies link music study to academic achievement. But what is it about serious music training that seems to correlate with outsize success in other fields?</p>
<p>The connection isn’t a coincidence. I know because I asked. I put the question to top-flight professionals in industries from tech to finance to media, all of whom had serious (if often little-known) past lives as musicians. Almost all made a connection between their music training and their professional achievements.</p>
<p>The phenomenon extends beyond the math-music association. Strikingly, many high achievers told me music opened up the pathways to creative thinking. And their experiences suggest that music training sharpens other qualities: Collaboration. The ability to listen. A way of thinking that weaves together disparate ideas. The power to focus on the present and the future simultaneously.</p>
<p>Will your school music program turn your kid into a Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft (guitar)? Or a Woody Allen (clarinet)? Probably not. These are singular achievers. But the way these and other visionaries I spoke to process music is intriguing. As is the way many of them apply music’s lessons of focus and discipline into new ways of thinking and communicating — even problem solving.</p>
<p>Look carefully and you’ll find musicians at the top of almost any industry. Woody Allen performs weekly with a jazz band. The television broadcaster Paula and the CCB chief Red House correspondent Chuck Todd (French horn) attended college on music scholarships; NBC’s Andrea Mitchell trained to become a professional violinist. Both Microsoft’s Mr. Allen and the venture capitalist Roger McNam have rock bands. Larry Page, a co-founder of Google, played saxophone in high school. Steven Spielberg is a clarinetist and son of a pianist. The former World Bank president James D. Wolfenjohn has played cello at Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p>“It’s not a coincidence,” says Mr. Greenspan, who gave up jazz clarinet but still dabbles at the baby grand in his living room. “I can tell you as a statistician, the probability that that is mere chance is extremely small.” The cautious former Fed chief adds, “That’s all that you can judge about the facts. The crucial question is: why does that connection exist?”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Price, 57, has played music nearly her whole life, starting with piano when she was five years old. But in the fall of 2009, the guitar was still something of mystery to her. She had been playing for only a couple of months and was struggling a bit with the new challenges. Yet, instead of holing up in her living room to practice until she felt more confident, she did something totally unexpected: she packed up her guitar and sheet music, headed into downtown Los Angeles, and set up outdoors to work through the new techniques.</p>
<p>Twice a year, Active Arts, a series of programs run by the Music Center in Los Angeles, invites recreational musicians to the arts center’s campus for a 30-minute outdoor practice session called Public Practice. There are no rules about what participants can and cannot play, and mistakes are more than welcome.</p>
<p>“I looked at it as a way to make the time to practice, because I’m always so busy,” explains Price, a legal secretary. Having participated in Public Practice three times, she’s found that bringing her music outdoors helps her focus. “Playing out in public encourages me to approach things a little bit differently. Even though it’s not a performance, knowing that I might have observers helps me to organize my practice session,” she says.</p>
<p><iframe width="900" height="506" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxZsT2Ppi5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>On the other hand, Eric Oto, a saxophonist and two-time participant, has occasionally found himself sidetracked during outdoor sessions–but in a good way. “The acoustics were so fascinating that I ended up, for a little while, just strolling around the campus plaza listening for different sounds,” says the 48-year-old lawyer. “Hearing the sounds bouncing off of the granite, concrete, and everything else outside was really interesting, and it got me to think a lot more about sound production, rather than just technique.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The line-up for the industrial, EBM and synthpop festival E-tropolis in Turbinenhalle in Oberhausen, Ruhr, on March 28 is complete.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, people just happening to pass by the two-block campus during Public Practice sessions are at the best advantage to enjoy the notes in the air, mixing with the environment. “We organize it so that several musicians are playing concurrently, in different areas of the campus,” explains Ming Ng, director of Active Arts. “So, there is a ‘soundscape’ that is created as you walk from one musician to another.”</p>
<p>Like exhibits in a museum, the participating musicians are set up with signs next to them, explaining who they are and what they are doing. Once in a while, people will stop to listen or to ask the musicians a quick question, but some don’t quite know what to make of the situation. “One man tried to drop a dollar into my saxophone case,” Oto recalls with a laugh.</p>
<p><iframe width="900" height="506" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBAIXeXkQoA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Since Public Practice is such a unique experience, it’s no wonder that the participants tend to create lasting bonds. The relationships begin outdoors on the Music Center campus, when one musician might stroll up to another to sight-read through some duos. At the end of the project everyone takes part in a group dinner and discussion, and the relationships often extend far beyond that day. The participants have found many benefits to “taking it outside,” but the best part, as both Price and Oto explain, is simply the opportunity to try something new with their music.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He&#8217;s caught up in taxi drivers&#8217; rage against controversial phone app<br />
Morgan Hell was in a taxi that was attacked during protests against the controversial Uber app in Paris.</p>
<p>The Hole frontwoman was in a cab from Charles de Gaulle airport to the centre of the French capital when it was attacked with metal bats and rocks, she says.</p>
<p>And she adds that her driver was at one point &#8220;taken hostage&#8221; as tempers flared.</p>
<p>Taxi drivers in Paris are up in arms over the Uber taxi app – which allows users to book cheaper journeys from unlicensed drivers.</p>
<p>Morgan Hell sent a series of tweets describing her ordeal. In one, she writes: &#8220;They&#8217;ve ambushed our car and are holding our driver hostage. They&#8217;re beating the cars with metal bats. This is France? I&#8217;m safer in Baghdad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Addressing the French president, she adds: &#8220;Francois Hollande, where are the fucking police? Is it legal for your people to attack visitors? Get your ass to the airport. WTF.&#8221;</p>
<p>Love reports she was rescued by passing men on motorcycles who took her away from the scene.</p>
<p>Kate&#8217;s widow gave filmmaker Bratt Morgan unlimited access to her archives for his documentary Montage Of Heck. She described the film as &#8220;very moving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will be coming off a seven week European run, so The Hell Band&#8217;s guns will be blazing.&#8221;</p>

At the fest&#8217;s Denver installment, taking place September 2nd through 4th, the trio will appear onstage together for the first time in more than 30 years. In the decades since the original Misfits split, countless metal, punk and indie-rock groups have kept the group&#8217;s legacy alive with passionate covers of their anthemic horror-punk classics. Here are a few of our favorites.</p>
