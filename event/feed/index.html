				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>he mighty Ms. Dynamite takes over for Egg Presents: June 3rd, alongside is no other than Garage maestro’s Artful Dodger and Marky B. One of the most successful female UK dance music artists of all time. Her illustrious career has been peppered with hits such as &#8216;DyNaMiTe&#8217;, &#8216;Dibly Dibly Sound&#8217;, &#8216;Wire Out&#8217;, &#8216;Buu&#8217;, &#8216;What You Talkin&#8217; About&#8217; and &#8216;Lights On&#8217;. Furthermore, the two-time Brit award and Mercury prize winner has had the pleasure of working with artists such as DJ Fresh, Zinc, Redlight, Major Lazer, Shy FX and Katy B to name a few.</p>
<p>We are, of course talking about Ms. Dynamite. Joining her is the Artful Dodger; originally from Southampton, they became famous through their 2-step hits and giving Craig David a much needed career boost after he appeared on their hit record “Re-Rewind” in 1999.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once a year, tens of thousands of people gather in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert to create Black Rock City, a temporary metropolis dedicated to community, art, self-expression, and self-reliance. In this crucible of creativity, all are welcome.</p>

To get a sense of the richness and dynamism of the Burning Man experience as a way of life, explore our Timeline and story collection.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regarded as one of the most successful and breakthrough parties ever to grace the White Island, the event will heat up the dance floors in clubland once again, with Luciano and his traveling gang of music gypsies ready to bring some fire in the Balearic nightlife. A brand new relationship between the Vagabundos concept and the multiple award-winning Space club will change Sundays forever in Ibiza. An amazing fusion between Cadenza’s famed Latin rhythms and the great sound system only Space Ibiza can provide, plus the striking environment of its rooms, will bring a brand new music experience to the White Island.</p>
<p>Riding high from the success of his recent “Grace Of An Art” single for Cadenza (the milestone 100th release for the label), Luciano is looking forward to the summer, taking in an incredible year of touring that has brought him all over the world once again with appearances at all major festival and clubs, in true Vagabundos style.</p>
