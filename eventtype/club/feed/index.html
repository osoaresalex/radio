				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>he mighty Ms. Dynamite takes over for Egg Presents: June 3rd, alongside is no other than Garage maestro’s Artful Dodger and Marky B. One of the most successful female UK dance music artists of all time. Her illustrious career has been peppered with hits such as &#8216;DyNaMiTe&#8217;, &#8216;Dibly Dibly Sound&#8217;, &#8216;Wire Out&#8217;, &#8216;Buu&#8217;, &#8216;What You Talkin&#8217; About&#8217; and &#8216;Lights On&#8217;. Furthermore, the two-time Brit award and Mercury prize winner has had the pleasure of working with artists such as DJ Fresh, Zinc, Redlight, Major Lazer, Shy FX and Katy B to name a few.</p>
<p>We are, of course talking about Ms. Dynamite. Joining her is the Artful Dodger; originally from Southampton, they became famous through their 2-step hits and giving Craig David a much needed career boost after he appeared on their hit record “Re-Rewind” in 1999.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regarded as one of the most successful and breakthrough parties ever to grace the White Island, the event will heat up the dance floors in clubland once again, with Luciano and his traveling gang of music gypsies ready to bring some fire in the Balearic nightlife. A brand new relationship between the Vagabundos concept and the multiple award-winning Space club will change Sundays forever in Ibiza. An amazing fusion between Cadenza’s famed Latin rhythms and the great sound system only Space Ibiza can provide, plus the striking environment of its rooms, will bring a brand new music experience to the White Island.</p>
<p>Riding high from the success of his recent “Grace Of An Art” single for Cadenza (the milestone 100th release for the label), Luciano is looking forward to the summer, taking in an incredible year of touring that has brought him all over the world once again with appearances at all major festival and clubs, in true Vagabundos style.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KlangKuenstler, aka Michael Korb, started his Zuckerton Records at the age of just 21, showing his precocious talent and laser beam focused enthusiasm. &#8216;Freudentraene&#8217;, his debut track from 2012 has so far clocked up over 3.5 million plays on YouTube with its dreamy, folk house sound. Since then he&#8217;s gone on to record for labels including Stil Vor Talent (clocking up 1.5 million SoundCloud plays for the pitched down hook of &#8216;Barfuss Auf Wolken&#8217;), Great Stuff Recordings and Toolroom, heading into techier, clubbier waters with tracks such as the recent &#8216;Jam Master Jack&#8217; &#8211; a thumping, swinging groover that samples Run DMC&#8217;s classic &#8216;It&#8217;s Like That&#8217; and hit No.1 in the Beatport Tech House Chart.</p>
