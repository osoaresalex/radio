				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As festival season rapidly rolls in, we’re constantly being reminded of the continuing lack of diversity on our lineups. With a recent study indicating 86 per cent of the lineups of 12 major music festivals last year including Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds and Creamfields were male, it seems that the ears at the top are still unwilling to break up the boys club that makes up our live music industry.</p>
<blockquote><p>Without music, life would be a mistake.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s not to say the diversity – and demand – isn’t there. With collectives such as SIREN and Discwoman championing female talent in the electronic music scene, and artists such as Björk, Grimes and Kesha speaking out in defence of women’s rights in the industry, there’s never seemed a more appropriate time to shake up our lineups. One group unwilling to wait for the wider industry to take note is Sad Grrrls Club. Originally founded by Rachel Maria Cox as a record label and booking agency in order for them to support non-binary and female acts and challenge Australia’s male-dominated live music scene, Cox has grown the organisation from it’s DIY roots to fully fledged music festival taking place across two cities.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Riot Grrrl movement as well as Audrey Wollen’s Sad Girl Theory, Sad Grrrls Fest showcases bands and musicians that have at least one female or non-binary member. But are all-female lineups breaking down the gender divide, or widening it even further? Below we caught up with the festival’s founder to discuss safer space policies, reverse sexism and the power of expressing our emotions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Bernardino County Supervisor Janice Rutherford said Tuesday she will place an item on the May 24 board agenda calling for an end to rave-style events at the San Manuel Amphiteater in Devore.</p>
<p>Rutherford’s decision came amid continued and growing complaints from Devore and Crestline residents about excessive noise generated from electronic dance shows at the venue, mainly the Nocturnal Wonderland and Beyond Wonderland electronic dance shows, until the wee hours. Residents said the music is so loud it causes their windows to rattle and their walls to vibrate.</p>
<p>In addition to the noise, the concerts draw heavy traffic that traps residents in their homes and is a magnet for rampant drug use and drug sales, overdose deaths and public indecency, residents say.</p>
<p>During an April 5 board meeting, Rutherford said dozens, if not hundreds, of residents have complained about the shows since they began at San Manuel Amphitheater in 2013, when the county entered into its contract with Live Nation Worldwide.</p>
<p>The dance shows were previously held at the National Orange Show Events Center in San Bernardino, but continued complaints of a similar nature from residents and business owners forced their relocation.</p>
<p>During the April 5 Board of Supervisors meeting, Rutherford asked County Counsel Jean-Rene Basle how best to invoke the provision of the county’s contract with Live Nation allowing the county to terminate the contract should the dance shows become a public safety hazard or are subject to resident complaints due to noise or other nuisance behavior. Basle suggested that Rutherford put it before the board for a vote.</p>

<p>What is that secret age-old productivity tool? Music.<br />
Yep. The right music can help you stay focused and more productive. Here’s how:<br />
Music Helps Boost Productivity on Repetitive Tasks</p>
<p>Research has shown that when presented with repetitive tasks, music can help make those tasks more enjoyable and boost productivity. In this study, for instance, assembly line workers reported feeling happier and experiencing higher efficiency while listening to music.</p>
<p>Studies suggest that this is because music helps boost mood and therefore contributes to productivity. One study from Canadian researchers looked at this concept. What they found was that time-on-task was shorter — which means they got the work done quicker — and the quality of work performed was better when music was playing. Not only did those listening to music complete tasks faster, but they also came up with better, more creative ideas when the music was on.</p>
<p>This concept of mood can be further explained. Listening to music at your desk can help drown out other distracting noises like chatting coworkers, the buzz of the copy machine, and the clicks of other people typing around you. Placing earbuds in your ears to drown all that noise out — or even having music play over the office’s speakers — creates a more consistent and enjoyable environment that makes you feel more comfortable and relaxed in the space.<br />
The New York Times further suggests that melodic tunes promote the release of dopamine, a feel-good chemical in the brain, which also contributes to that good mood and promotes a more productive working environment.</p>
<p>All of this suggests that music may be a valuable tool in boosting efficiency when performing mundane tasks, such as data entry or answering emails. Some suggest that when trying to focus on a complex task, music can be distracting – just as a noisy office may distract workers. But that doesn’t mean all music is bad for creative tasks. It’s just that the same type of music may not be appropriate in both situations. In fact, studies show that moderate levels of ambient noise can boost creativity, so you have to be conscious of what type of music is playing, and select it based on the task at hand.</p>

<p>Also on the show: A new studio recording of &#8220;Some Day We&#8217;ll Linger In The Sun,&#8221; the heartbreakingly beautiful song by Haar Lea that won this year&#8217;s Tiny Desk contest; A troubled love story from singer Haar and mangled, electronic rock from the Toronto-based band Holy F***.</p>
<p>But before we can even think of playing any music, Robin needs to pound his seventh cup of coffee of the day and welcome Bob back from his week on the road.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Consider heart disease, the No. 1 killer of women, killing more women than all cancers combined. If we can do more to prevent, treat and cure cardiovascular disease, more women will live longer, more families will stay together, more workers will stay productive, and we’ll save money on treating a condition that costs the U.S. nearly a billion dollars a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, diversifying research and clinical trials will improve health outcomes for everyone. Better understanding of sex differences will not only fill in critical gaps on women’s health but can improve men’s health as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;To give an example, looking at disease through the sex and gender lens has driven new insights regarding atrial fibrillation (AFib), a dangerous condition marked by an irregular heartbeat that can lead to stroke, blood clots, heart failure and other heart complications. For many years, research failed to find an association between physical activity and AFib. Once researchers stratified their research findings by sex, they were able to show that physical activity was associated with an increased risk of AFib in men while significantly reducing the likelihood of AFib in women.</p>
<p>Many other areas of health are affected by sex and gender, from susceptibility to depression to response to medication to addiction to nicotine and other drugs. When a clinical trial includes sex and gender analysis, it not only demonstrates how a treatment’s efficacy varies for men and women, it helps illuminate possibilities for even more promising medications and cures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last month, the U.S. Senate HELP Committee passed a series of biomedical innovation bills, which can be bundled into a companion to the House-passed 21st Century Cures Act. We applaud this bipartisan commitment to fighting disease and saving lives. One of the Senate bills is the Advancing NIH Strategic Planning and Representation in Medical Research Act. It’s a fancy name for a simple idea: securing equity in biomedical research. Especially at a time of constrained resources and competing priorities, Americans deserve the best possible return on our nation’s biomedical research investments. We urge the Congress to pass this legislation, for our health and for our future.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The package was recorded in Liverpool on the Acolyte to Wolflight With Genesis Revisited Tour.</p>
<p>Steve Packett is set to release of a brand new double live album and DVD this summer.</p>
<p>Titled ‘The Total Experience Live In Liverpool’, the 2CD/2DVD deluxe package and stand-a-lone Blu-Ray was recorded on StevIe’s Acolyte to Wolflight With Genesis Revisited Tour in 2015 at the Liverpool Philharmonic.</p>
<p>“When Inside Out told me that I could film a gig on the British leg of the 2015 tour for release, I thought that we should do it away from London (and) I felt doing it in Liverpool had a certain ring to it,” says Steve.</p>
<p>“This is an extraordinary city and the Philharmonic Hall is an extraordinary venue. Besides, it&#8217;s not as if Liverpool is known for having any good music – there&#8217;s never been a good band from there. Ha!”</p>
<p>The tour celebrated the 40th anniversary of his debut solo album ‘Voyage Of The Acolyte’ and boasted two sets – one focusing on his solo career and the other containing a host of Genesis classics.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dj Boom re-examined the band&#8217;s past for the upcoming deluxe reissue of 2003&#8217;s It Still Moves. The remixed, remastered set includes 10 of the frontman&#8217;s original demos – including a ragged, revealing take on &#8220;Golden,&#8221; which debuted Wednesday via NPR. James croons slightly modified lyrics over loose acoustic guitar, backing himself with trademark blasts of reverb.</p>
<p>The band also promoted the reissue with a trippy teaser-trailer. Soundtracked by the revved-up &#8220;One Big Holiday&#8221; and &#8220;Golden,&#8221; the clip previews the LP&#8217;s revamped artwork and features psychedelic shots of the band&#8217;s signature spirit-animal bear.</p>
<p>It Still Moves was Dj Boom&#8217;s third album, cementing their Southern-psychedelia style and launching the band into a new realm of acclaim and visibility. According to James, the group&#8217;s hectic touring schedule forced them to hurry through the recording sessions, which left the songs with an &#8220;unfinished&#8221; feeling – now remedied with the reissue. &#8220;Everybody can relate to something they&#8217;ve done in their life where you didn&#8217;t know it at the time, but you were rushed through finishing it,&#8221; James said in a statement.</p>
<p>The dj recently told The New York Times that he&#8217;s prepping a new solo LP for release this fall, with a follow-up to MMJ&#8217;s 2015 LP, The Waterfall, plotted for 2017. &#8220;Another Jacket record is in progress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just recently rediscovered this desire for scorching rock n&#8217; roll, and that&#8217;s hopefully what we&#8217;ll get around to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reissue, out May 27th, marks ATO&#8217;s 15th anniversary. It will include three previously unreleased tracks, &#8220;En La Ceremony,&#8221; &#8220;Grab a Body&#8221; and &#8220;That&#8217;s Too Bad.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixteen years after they broke up and five years since they last played together, Rage Against the Machine appear poised to start taking the power back and it sounds like they have Public Enemy on their side.<br />
The hugely influential ’90s outfit have launched a mysterious new website called Prophets of Rage with a countdown leading to June 1. After submitting an e-mail address, visitors then receive an image that reads: “Clear the way for the prophets of rage.” That’s a reference to Public Enemy’s “Prophets of Rage,” and Pitchfork reports that posters with the image have started sprouting around Los Angeles.<br />
Whether it’s a reunion tour or a long-awaited new Rage album, Public Enemy’s Chuck D appears to know what’s up. Last night, he tweeted links to video of Rage performing in London in 2010.<br />
Of course, you probably can’t say Rage are surprised by the way the world has changed since they were last on the scene: they predicted Donald Trump would run for president back in 1999.</p>
