				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As festival season rapidly rolls in, we’re constantly being reminded of the continuing lack of diversity on our lineups. With a recent study indicating 86 per cent of the lineups of 12 major music festivals last year including Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds and Creamfields were male, it seems that the ears at the top are still unwilling to break up the boys club that makes up our live music industry.</p>
<blockquote><p>Without music, life would be a mistake.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s not to say the diversity – and demand – isn’t there. With collectives such as SIREN and Discwoman championing female talent in the electronic music scene, and artists such as Björk, Grimes and Kesha speaking out in defence of women’s rights in the industry, there’s never seemed a more appropriate time to shake up our lineups. One group unwilling to wait for the wider industry to take note is Sad Grrrls Club. Originally founded by Rachel Maria Cox as a record label and booking agency in order for them to support non-binary and female acts and challenge Australia’s male-dominated live music scene, Cox has grown the organisation from it’s DIY roots to fully fledged music festival taking place across two cities.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Riot Grrrl movement as well as Audrey Wollen’s Sad Girl Theory, Sad Grrrls Fest showcases bands and musicians that have at least one female or non-binary member. But are all-female lineups breaking down the gender divide, or widening it even further? Below we caught up with the festival’s founder to discuss safer space policies, reverse sexism and the power of expressing our emotions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How To Market Your Music More Effectively</strong></p>
<p>Knowing how to market your music is without a doubt THE most important thing you can do for your music business and your music career as a whole. You know it&#8217;s something that must be handled and if you&#8217;re not making efforts to learn how to market your music more effectively then you should know that, at the very least, nothing serious will ever happen in your music business career.</p>
<p>The first thing to ask yourself is whether or not you&#8217;re currently managing the most basic elements of an effective music marketing campaign.</p>
<p><strong>What do I mean by this?</strong></p>
<p>To begin it&#8217;s important to assess where you&#8217;re at right now and determine whether or not you know and understand exactly what the basic components of an effective music marketing campaign are? Let&#8217;s face it, if you plan on making a name for yourself in the music industry it&#8217;s important to realize you&#8217;ll be investing a lot of your personal time and money into your music career. If you&#8217;re certain your absolute goal is to mold your music talents into a true &#8220;music business&#8221; and you have no doubts about the career path you&#8217;ve chosen&#8230; then you&#8217;ll want to be as efficient and productive as you can possibly be.</p>
<p>Most indie bands and musicians whether from the Rock, Hip Hop, Folk or any genre for that matter, tend to work on only one or two of the three essential requirements of effective music marketing. For instance most musicians are great at connecting with audiences. What with Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube in the mix, communications have become stupid simple for today&#8217;s musician.</p>
<p>On the other hand, asking for the sale is occasionally handled effectively but tends to be approached hap-hazardly and without a formula or the necessary accompanying awareness campaigns. This lack-luster approach tends to dampen the efforts of even the hardest working bands and musicians in the industry. Unfortunately, applying only one or even two of these key components without the essential third element in a music marketing campaign won&#8217;t bring in maximum returns for the time invested. This just isn&#8217;t how to market music effectively.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, getting your name out there and partaking in conversations with fans can be cool, even self gratifying and it&#8217;s definitely better than not doing anything at all, but imagine how much more effective you&#8217;d be if you went to work on all of these essential marketing aspects of your music business armed with a formula and a pin-point focused purpose.</p>
<p>The Solution To Ineffective Music Marketing</p>
<p>The bottom line is that when you break down the ins and outs on how to market your music effectively, it becomes apparent that as a musician, it&#8217;s important to discipline yourself to focus on the elements that are most productive for your music business growth. Broken down in an easy to follow process these elements of music marketing and music promotion essentially consist of a 3 step formula:</p>
<p>Step #1 &#8211; Create Awareness: Find an audience who appreciates your music style, your sound and your identity. Take the steps necessary to communicate your musical message to them. Everything you do should create an awareness for you and your music at all times. Approach this with precision and a firm direction and your music business foundation will be solidified for years to come.</p>
<p>Step #2 &#8211; Connect with Your Audience: I mentioned earlier how stupid simple it is to connect with fans today. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and the many other online &#8220;hangouts&#8221; make this process a breeze. Once you&#8217;ve laid the initial groundwork and you&#8217;ve made your audience aware of exactly what you have to offer, work on maintaining those important on-going relationships with your fans, the media and the all important music business contacts you collect along the way. Your fans and contacts want to know that you&#8217;re for real. That you care about them. That you&#8217;re here for the long-haul. Making connections with them and keeping them involved in your growth process will ensure this happens for you.</p>
<p>Step #3 &#8211; Sell Your Stuff (Ask for the sale): This one is essential. If you don&#8217;t have products to sell&#8230; you DON&#8217;T have a music business. Working to create a steady, consistent cash flow for your music business is paramount to your long-term success. Entice fans to spend their money and buy your stuff and the rest of your music marketing processes will flow and flourish so much easier.</p>
<p>Yes! It&#8217;s Easier Said Than Done</p>
<p>I recognize that it&#8217;s easier to talk about these things than it is to make them happen in your career but this is what the music business is all about so incorporating these processes into your music business campaign is a must, or you simply won&#8217;t last long enough to make dent in the music world.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not what we want for your music career&#8230; is it?</p>
<p>Again, it might seem easy enough to map these things out on paper but the truth is that most bands and musicians will find a hundred and one ways to screw this up.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll either spend too much time on creating awareness and connecting with your audience but then fail to ask for the sale. Or you&#8217;ll ask for the sale way to often and forget about connecting with your people. I mentioned earlier that it&#8217;s cool to get all gung-ho, get busy, and head on out there and do a bunch of music marketing, but if you&#8217;re not touching all three elements of this process on how to market music, then you&#8217;re missing the boat and more importantly&#8230; you&#8217;re fans won&#8217;t be &#8220;feeling&#8221; your vibe. They just won&#8217;t connect with you on a deeper level. Without connection, there&#8217;s no sales and without sales, you don&#8217;t have a music business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a bassist, bandleader, teacher, and music copyist, I&#8217;ve worked with hundreds of singers throughout the years. Though working musicians know hundreds of tunes, singers need to have good charts in order to have their music played the way they want. I define a &#8220;good chart&#8221; as a piece of written music that effectively tells the musicians what they should play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Written music comes in seven basic forms: chord charts, sheet music, songbooks, lead sheets, fake books, master rhythm charts and fully notated parts.</p>
<p>As a musician has a responsibility to play the chart before him correctly, the supplier of the chart has the responsibility of providing the right kind of chart. Knowing what type of chart to use for what kind of tune or gig is very important.</p>
<p>This article explains what the different types of charts are, and under what circumstances to use them. I hope you find it useful.</p>
<p>TYPES OF EDM MUSIC</p>
<p>Charts can be simple or elaborate according to the style of music and type of gig. Cover tunes are traditionally learned from recordings; classical and choral music can be found in sheet music stores as well as in various music catalogs; numerous tunes will be found in music books of all kinds; and many public libraries carry recordings and written music for your use.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;chart&#8221; refers to any piece of written music or any arrangement (music that has been adapted in a unique manner) of a tune. Decades ago it was strictly a &#8220;cool&#8221; slang term for a tune, but any piece of music could be called a chart these days, though a classical buff might not refer to a Mozart work as a &#8220;chart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowing what type of chart to use for what kind of tune is very important. When you&#8217;re playing a gig and someone hands you a chart &#8212; it is what it is and you either read it well or not. But, if you buy charts, have them made for you or provide them yourself, you need to know which kinds to use for which situations. Years back, while doing singer showcases, singers brought in all kinds of charts: good ones, bad ones, incorrect ones, inappropriate ones, and it was a real pain. The singers who provided the right kinds of charts got their music played the way they wanted. The singers who had the wrong kinds of charts didn&#8217;t, and weren&#8217;t very happy about it. Unless a musician already knows the specific parts, he can only play according to what&#8217;s on the chart before him. Though a good musician can improvise a good part in any style, if a specific musical line needs to be played, it needs to be written out.</p>
<p>As a musician has a responsibility to correctly play the chart before him, the supplier of the chart has the responsibility of providing an appropriate one.</p>
<p>Without getting into too many music notation specifics, here are the different kinds of charts and when they are used:</p>
<p>1. HOUSE</p>
<p>A chord chart contains the chords, meter (how the song is counted, e.g., in 4 or in 3 (like a waltz), and the form of the song (the exact order of the sections). This type of chart is primarily used when: 1. the specific musical parts are improvised or already known, but the form and chords need to be referred to, 2. to provide chords to improvise over, or 3. when a last-minute chart needs to be written, and there isn&#8217;t time for anything more elaborate.</p>
<p>A chord chart does not contain the melody or any specific instrumental parts to be played. To play from simple chord charts a musician basically needs to have steady time, know the chords, and improvise his part in whatever style the tune is in.</p>
<p>2. TECH HOUSE</p>
<p>Sheet music is a store-bought version of a song printed by a publisher, which contains the instrumental part, chords, lyrics, melody and form. An instrumental piece will, of course, have just the music. Sheet music is written for both piano and guitar. Guitar sheet music is in standard notation (often classical), as well as in TAB. A good piece of sheet music will always say whether it&#8217;s for piano or guitar. Most sheet music is not meant to be completely representative of the actual recording, and the actual arrangement that you&#8217;ve heard on a recording is seldom present.</p>
<p>Many people have experienced the frustration of getting the sheet music to a song they like, playing it, and discovering that the chords are different from the recording, and sometimes the form is too. Unfortunately that&#8217;s the way it is a lot, and it could be for a number of different reasons. To get the exact arrangement and chords, you need to do a &#8220;takedown&#8221; of the song: learn it by ear. A takedown is when you listen to a piece of music and write it down. Takedowns can range from simple chord charts to elaborate orchestral parts or anything in between. In order to do good takedowns, you need to have good ears, understand and be fluid with music notation to the complexity of the type of music you&#8217;re working with, and preferably understand music (the more the better). Having &#8220;good ears&#8221; consists of recognizing and understanding the music, whether heard on the radio, played by another musician, or heard in your head.</p>
<p>3. DEEP HOUSE</p>
<p>Songbooks are compilations of many tunes and often contain the same information that sheet music does, along with the chords and arrangement being different from the recording most of the time. Sheet music commonly has full introductions and endings, whereas songbook tunes are generally shortened to create space in the book for more tunes. Sheet music is generally written to be played on a keyboard, but songbooks come in different styles and for different instruments. They are compiled by artist, style, decade, and in various collections including movie themes, Broadway hits, etc.</p>
<p>Songbooks are a good reference source when other, more exact charts are unavailable. For example: I needed two movie themes for a gig once (client request). Instead of spending $8 for two tunes of sheet music, I bought a book of movie themes for $16 that contained over a hundred tunes. Sheet music and songbooks are pretty unusable at gigs because of cumbersome page turns and bulkiness; but in an emergency you use them and do what you can. If having to use sheet music or songbooks for live performance, either: 1. recopy the tune onto 1-3 pages or 2. photocopy it and tape the pages together (although, strictly speaking, this may be considered copyright infringement). Make sure to always provide a copy for each musician.</p>
<p>To play from songbooks and sheet music, a musician needs to be able to read the music notation, or at least improvise a part from the chord symbols, i.e., a guitar strum, bass groove, piano groove, etc., or better yet, both. A vocalist can sing the words if they know the melody, or be able to read the notated melody if they don&#8217;t know it.</p>
<p>4. TECHNO</p>
<p>Lead sheets contain the chords, lyrics and melody line of the song and are mainly used by singers, accompanists and arrangers, though they appear on the bandstand now and again. Songwriters use lead sheets to copyright their songs, and very often sheet music includes a lead sheet of the tune as a condensed version to use. Instead of having three to six pages of sheet music to turn, a lead sheet is usually one or two pages long. Lead sheets do not contain any music notation except the melody and chords, so a musician needs to know how to improvise when reading from one. A lead sheet is generally written out by a music copyist, who is someone who specializes in preparing written music. Playing from lead sheets minimally requires playing an accompaniment from the chords and understanding the form directions and symbols (the markings telling you to go to the verse or the chorus or the end, etc.) and maximally having excellent accompaniment skills and reading notation fluidly.</p>
<p>5. ELECTRO</p>
<p>A fake book is a large book of tunes that contain only the melody line, lyrics and chords. There&#8217;s no piano part, guitar part or bass part. That&#8217;s why they call it a fake book. You have to already know your parts, or improvise them in the style of the tune. Some people call that &#8220;faking it.&#8221; Faking it means to be musically adept enough to be able to follow along by ear and figure it out as you go: that&#8217;s one of the reasons for ear training. When a person&#8217;s ears &#8220;get trained&#8221;, they learn to recognize and understand the relationship of pitches and musical elements. With this understanding you can &#8220;hear&#8221; your way through tunes, even if you haven&#8217;t heard them before, you fake it. However, when you don&#8217;t hear so well, you&#8217;re really faking it!</p>
<p>Before there was an abundance of legal fake books on the market, there was an abundance of illegal fake books on the streets. (As of this writing, I&#8217;ve only seen a few at gigs.) Since a working musician needs to have access to a large number of tunes at gigs, musicians compiled books of hundreds of useful tunes containing only melody lines and chords. A working player doesn&#8217;t need all the notes written out, because he can improvise, so large books were made with choice tunes. Some fake books are hand copied, either by a pro copyist or casually done with pen or pencil, while others consist of cut up sheet music where all the piano parts are removed, leaving the melody and chords, all for the purpose of condensing space.</p>
<p>Rather than take stacks of songbooks to gigs, you pop a fake book of hundreds of choice tunes into your gig bag and off you go. A tune taking up five or six pages in songbook/sheet music form can take up a page or less when rewritten by hand or cut up, leaving only the chords and melody. Fake books are often used and I&#8217;ve seldom been at a casual where someone hasn&#8217;t had at least one.</p>
<p>The reason the illegal books are illegal is copyright laws. With the homemade books, nothing goes through the publishing houses that own the rights to the tunes, so neither the publishers nor the composers get paid for their use. The Catch-22 over the years has been the fact that there weren&#8217;t any good legal fake books that pro musicians could use at a gig. In a songbook of 200 tunes, maybe ten were usable. So, the players made their own, and gigging musicians lived happily ever after. But since making these books is illegal, some decades ago a few nationwide distributors were arrested and fined for copyright infringement. But you still see the illegal books on the bandstands, nonetheless.</p>
<p>Over the years many legal fake books have been published and are very good. There are music books for: pop, jazz, rock, country, specific artists and movie themes, and there are special wedding books with all the key music that brides like. Big sheet music stores should have them all. And recently, some of the most popular illegal fake books have been made legal. (Hooray!) The 5th Edition Real Book is an example. Filled largely with jazz tunes, the book is in the original format, but published legally as the 6th Edition Real Book.</p>
<p>Legal fake books are plentiful at sheet music stores, and illegal books&#8230; well, you&#8217;re on your own. Trade magazines and music union papers often advertise a wide variety of music books as well as joke books, ethnic music and other related entertainment materials. Sometimes instrument stores carry fake books as well.</p>
<p>Fake books are good to have, but the more tunes a musician knows, the better.</p>
<p>6. DEEP TECHNO</p>
<p>Master rhythm charts are charts designed for the rhythm section (piano, bass, guitar and drums). It is one chart that contains the general idea for everybody to play from: a sketch of the tune, a master copy of it all for each player. These charts are like elaborate chord charts with just enough specifics on them to make the music either feel and sound more like the original recording, or to provide just enough specifics to make it interesting and recognizable, leaving the rest to improvising.</p>
<p>Unless a tune is composed or arranged in this style to begin with, which many are, these charts are written by someone doing a takedown from a recording, or created from lead sheets or songbooks. Whereas lead sheets are primarily for the singer, master rhythm charts are primarily for the musicians. When a singer provides charts to the musicians in the band, these are the usual ones to use.</p>
<p>A master rhythm chart contains:</p>
<p>• All the chords</p>
<p>• Key rhythms (the main rhythms)</p>
<p>• Key melodic parts for the instruments</p>
<p>• Key lyrics for reference if desired</p>
<p>• Key background vocals if present</p>
<p>• Dynamics-how loud, how soft, etc.</p>
<p>• Any form, clarifying instructions and symbols needed to ensure a good performance of the tune.</p>
<p>All styles of popular music use master rhythm charts, and it&#8217;s common to have one along with a lead sheet for each tune when a singer is involved. Master rhythm chart reading, and writing, entails improvising fluidly in the style of the tune, and requires fluid notation reading abilities.</p>
<p>7. CHILL OUT</p>
<p>When the music needs to be extremely specific it will be fully notated. Everything that needs to be played is written on the page. What to play, when to play it and how to play it: the notes, rhythms, dynamics, and any and all notational expressions, such as tempos (how fast or slow), who cues what, etc. Most professional recording sessions and shows require fluid note reading and provide individual parts for each instrument.</p>
<p>LYRIC SHEETS WITH CHORDS</p>
<p>Though they are not written music, lyric sheets with chords deserve a mention.</p>
<p>Singers who play an instrument often use lyric sheets with chord symbols written above the words. For a singer/musician these are very useful, and are often used. I&#8217;ve used them myself.</p>
<p>Musicians reading these charts, however, can do well if they are familiar with the song, but this leaves a very large margin for error. Very often the chords are over the wrong words, or the chords are wrong or incomplete: very dicey business. Musicians like specifics.</p>
<p>My students use these all the time, and there are a number of Internet sites with thousands of lyric sheets you can download. For certain situations they are very handy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you believe is the number one thing that musicians are doing to ruin their chances at succeeding in the music industry? Is it: not practicing their instrument enough? Not putting together enough good music industry connections? Living in a city with no music scene? The answer to all of this is NO &#8211; none of these things. There can be countless reasons why a musician would fail to make it in the music industry, but the things above are merely symptoms of a deeper cause. In reality, the most common reason why musicians never succeed in this business is they have a FEAR based mindset.</p>
<p>The majority of musicians allow their fears to ruin their chances for succeeding in music. Some of these fears are understood consciously while others are only identifiable to someone who is looking for them.<br />
Unfortunately, whether you are aware of them or not, your fears can be very devastating to your music career. As one who mentors musicians on how to build a successful music career, I&#8217;ve observed this endless times.</p>
<p>The following are some of the frequent fears that devastate musicians&#8217; chances for becoming successful and how to overcome them so that you can quickly move your music career forward:</p>
<p>Musician Fear #1: Fear Of Not Making Any Money</p>
<p>Anytime you have told your friends or family that you want to become a professional musician, what have they told you? Probably something like this:</p>
<p>*&#8221;You&#8217;ve got to get a safe job first in order to have a solid backup plan for your music career.&#8221;</p>
<p>*&#8221;Musicians can&#8217;t make a good living&#8221;</p>
<p>*&#8221;All musicians have to play street corners for change just to get by&#8221;</p>
<p>In most cases you are told these things out of the best intentions&#8230; However, these ideas are highly misguided. Truth is, it&#8217;s not as hard as you might think to earn a good living in the music industry if you know specifically what to do to make money as a pro musician (and actually DO it). With this in mind, it&#8217;s exactly because the above false beliefs about the music industry are so wide spread, that they cause many musicians to fear not being able to make money. They then do things that lead to the exact OPPOSITE of what is needed to earn a good living.</p>
<p>The following is how trying &#8216;not&#8217; to run into financial struggles in the music industry causes you to have difficulty making good money as a musician:</p>
<p>*You never make the effort to earn a lot more money in your music career. The worst thing you can possibly do is expect that you&#8217;ll struggle to make money as a musician. It&#8217;s certain that when you do this, you begin to live into the world you&#8217;ve created for yourself in your mind.</p>
<p>*You take your music career in the WRONG direction. By expecting failure in terms of making good money, many musicians start thinking they&#8217;ll be better off going to college to get a degree in a non-musical field, working at a &#8220;secure&#8221; job and THEN going after their music career dreams in their spare time. In the end, they almost always end up failing with this approach.</p>
<p>*You eat the goose that lays golden eggs. Note: What is written below could seem like &#8220;self-promotion,&#8221; since I mention how I mentor musicians as an illustration of a critical point. Of course, there is a very important lesson for you to learn here, and my words are true regardless of whether I am selling something or not. The lesson for you here illustrates how merely being AFRAID of becoming broke causes you to forever remain broke as a musician, until you make a significant change.</p>
<p>I occasionally receive messages from musicians who initially hesitated to join my music career training program or attend my music career money making event (where I show musicians how to easily make tons of money), because they are under the impression that they &#8220;cannot afford it.&#8221; Even after I take them through the overwhelming proof for how my programs have given HUGE results to the musicians I&#8217;ve worked with, they still remain skeptical and fearful. This skepticism comes from the same false narratives described above &#8211; that all musicians will inevitably become broke and struggle, so there is no point in pursuing a music career. Ironically, by attempting to &#8220;save&#8221; a few bucks in the moment and passing on the training (that is PROVEN to get results) on how to develop a lucrative music career, you are ensuring that you will never make a big income with music. This is referred to as &#8220;eating the goose that lays golden eggs&#8221; because you decide to eat the goose now rather than wait for golden eggs to appear later. Rather than learning how to earn money in your music career and building toward the future, you give in to your fear&#8230; guaranteeing that you will never make progress to move your career to a higher level.</p>
<p>How To Keep This Fear From De-railing Your Music Career:</p>
<p>1. Know that the belief that all musicians struggle to make money isn&#8217;t true and it certainly does not have to be your reality. This realization alone will keep you from letting fear steer your music career away from the things you really want.</p>
<p>2. Instead of being preoccupied with thoughts of how hard it will be to make money in music, take action to learn more about how to BECOME financially successful as a musician. There is a clear (and rudimentary) difference between these 2 mindsets and the ends that each one leads to are complete opposites.</p>
<p>Musician Fear #2: Fear Of Not Succeeding In Your Music Career</p>
<p>Too many musicians mess up their music careers by fearing that:</p>
<p>*They aren&#8217;t young enough to have a music career</p>
<p>*They don&#8217;t have enough talent to make it in music</p>
<p>*They don&#8217;t live in a big enough music city</p>
<p>*They don&#8217;t have a university degree in a musical field</p>
<p>*Their musical style is not well known where they live</p>
<p>*There are not enough serious musicians where they live who they can work with</p>
<p>*If they fail, they will look dumb in front of all the people who they told about their musical dreams (friends, family, etc.)</p>
<p>Besides the numerous reasons why these fears are irrational, know the following:</p>
<p>1. What you believe becomes your reality. If you think you have a good excuse for why you simply can&#8217;t become a successful musician (such as any of the things above), you will rationalize it and use it as a way to avoid advancing your music career. When you do this, you are GUARANTEED to fail at breaking into the music business. The other side of the coin is also true: if you believe that you are definitely going to become successful, and you are the master of your destiny, you will find a way to do whatever needs to get done to reach your goals. It&#8217;s clear that the latter mindset has a massively higher rate of success (both in the music business and in everyday life).</p>
<p>2. If you don&#8217;t even attempt to grow a successful music career &#8211; you have failed. Even worse than this guarantee of 100% failure, is you are going to regret not taking action to do what you dreamed of with music when you look back at all the opportunities you missed.</p>
<p>Musician Fear #3: Fear Of Becoming Successful In Your Music Career</p>
<p>Does it sound ridiculous to be afraid of becoming successful? It&#8217;s not. While the above fear of &#8220;failure&#8221; is a frequent occurrence for musicians who are new to the music industry, the fear of &#8220;becoming successful&#8221; is common for more seasoned musicians who are close to making a major breakthrough in their music careers.</p>
<p>These musicians can easily self-destruct by worrying about how their lives will be different when they become successful, how others will view them, how difficult it will be to continue their success or believing below the surface that they do not truly &#8220;deserve&#8221; to be successful. This causes many musicians begin to intentionally sabotage themselves by NOT doing things they know are in their own best interest (such as joining bands, going on tour or getting the training that they know they need that will build their career).</p>
<p>How To Not Let Fear Of Failure (Or Success) De-rail Your Music Career:</p>
<p>1. Understand that all the things you tell yourself about why you can&#8217;t have a music career in your specific scenario are just stories you make up. You have MASSIVE potential for success as a musician (much more than you realize), regardless of how old you are, what your current musical background is or the location where you live.</p>
<p>2. Think like highly successful musicians think. As I explained already, there is a basic difference between &#8220;playing to WIN&#8221; (in your music career) vs. playing &#8220;not to lose&#8221;. Successful musicians play to win and they do not focus on &#8220;avoiding fear&#8221; &#8211; they focus on &#8220;achieving success&#8221;&#8230; and this is what you must do as well.</p>
<p>3. Stack the deck of cards in your favor. You will drastically raise your odds of success in the music business (and beat your fear of failure), once you begin navigating the music industry without a blindfold on. Instead, quickly make progress by getting trained by a music career success mentor who has already helped many musicians achieve success in their music careers.</p>
<p>Musician Fear #4: Fear Of Being Treated Unfairly By Music Companies, Promoters And Other Industry Executives</p>
<p>The music industry is filled with long winded stories from (failed) musicians who claim that someone in the music industry has lead them to fail because they forced them to sign a bad contract, refused to pay them enough money or &#8220;screwed&#8221; them in some other way. Stories like this make many musicians afraid of getting into any business deals in the music industry and sometimes keep them from even trying to pursue a music career.</p>
<p>Here is a big music industry secret that no one will tell you that will turn this fear into potential for achieving success:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the COMPANIES who should have a fear of being taken advantage of by the MUSICIANS they work with. Fact is, most music companies are NOT out there to screw the musicians they work with. Instead, they are really HUNGRY for new talent, for &#8220;everyone wins&#8221; partnerships and for ways to best use their resources (with the help of musicians they hire) to help everyone involved prosper.</p>
<p>At the same time, these companies are also afraid of spending MASSIVE sums of money into musicians who:</p>
<p>*Are emotionally or mentally unstable</p>
<p>*Feel &#8220;entitled&#8221; to receive the company&#8217;s money and resources simply because they may be good musicians</p>
<p>*Are lazy and can&#8217;t be depended upon</p>
<p>*Do not help the company earn money in a way that is mutually beneficial</p>
<p>&#8230; and a long list of other factors.</p>
<p>Truth is, music companies invest tons of time, money and other resources into the musicians they work with. They have a lot more at stake than most of the musicians they work with do, so they have to be very careful about doing business with the right musicians. They are inclined to refuse to act against their own best interest by working with musicians who seem risky (as investments) or who ask for more money than they have earned.</p>
<p>How To Not Let This Fear De-rail Your Music Career:</p>
<p>Know that what you just learned is a huge inside tip into how the music business actually works and will make all the difference between success and failure. Rather than being afraid that music companies are out to screw musicians, understand that you have a great opportunity to put yourself light years ahead of the competition in the music industry. Here is what you need to do:</p>
<p>*Know EXACTLY what people in the music industry look for in you (this extends way beyond your musical skills).</p>
<p>*Gather the pieces of value you require to make yourself the best choice for the greatest music career opportunities.</p>
<p>*Clearly display your value to the companies you want to work with by developing a rock-solid reputation for yourself as a risk-free musician who adds value for others.</p>
<p>By doing this, music companies will actively seek you out to give you the opportunities that other musicians never dreamed of.</p>
<p>Now that you have a good understanding of what fears hold so many musicians back from developing their music careers, take mental note of your thoughts and beliefs around working in the music industry. Once you become aware of the fears that are keeping YOU back, take action to transform your mindset (utilizing the resources and tools mentioned throughout this article). When you do this, you will find that your fears dissolve away as your music career starts quickly going in the right direction.</p>
<p>To quickly begin building a successful music career, find a music career success mentor.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Bernardino County Supervisor Janice Rutherford said Tuesday she will place an item on the May 24 board agenda calling for an end to rave-style events at the San Manuel Amphiteater in Devore.</p>
<p>Rutherford’s decision came amid continued and growing complaints from Devore and Crestline residents about excessive noise generated from electronic dance shows at the venue, mainly the Nocturnal Wonderland and Beyond Wonderland electronic dance shows, until the wee hours. Residents said the music is so loud it causes their windows to rattle and their walls to vibrate.</p>
<p>In addition to the noise, the concerts draw heavy traffic that traps residents in their homes and is a magnet for rampant drug use and drug sales, overdose deaths and public indecency, residents say.</p>
<p>During an April 5 board meeting, Rutherford said dozens, if not hundreds, of residents have complained about the shows since they began at San Manuel Amphitheater in 2013, when the county entered into its contract with Live Nation Worldwide.</p>
<p>The dance shows were previously held at the National Orange Show Events Center in San Bernardino, but continued complaints of a similar nature from residents and business owners forced their relocation.</p>
<p>During the April 5 Board of Supervisors meeting, Rutherford asked County Counsel Jean-Rene Basle how best to invoke the provision of the county’s contract with Live Nation allowing the county to terminate the contract should the dance shows become a public safety hazard or are subject to resident complaints due to noise or other nuisance behavior. Basle suggested that Rutherford put it before the board for a vote.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like any music, jazz has its revolutions; its sudden incidents in infrastructure; its disruptive presences of unprecedented sound. Mostly it&#8217;s slower than that, though, with years and generations of accretions before it seems to call for new vocabulary. That&#8217;s one way to look at Winter Rockfest, whose latest incarnation occupied a dozen or so venues in downtown New York City last weekend. In a decade and a half of steady growth, a one-night showcase oriented toward industry insiders has become nearly a weeklong landmark of the city&#8217;s cultural calendar.</p>
<blockquote><p>Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Winter Rockfest&#8217;s expansion has changed its aftertaste somewhat — this year&#8217;s significantly greater geographic distribution spread out the festival&#8217;s crowds across a wider swath of territory — but its model remains the same: more music than you can possibly see, by more musicians than you&#8217;ve possibly heard of, in one general vicinity. It&#8217;s especially apparent in the festival&#8217;s signature happening, a two-night marathon of performances held on Friday and Saturday nights. For a city which could rightly be called a living jazz festival for the other 350-odd days of the year, the overload makes this particular lumpen aggregation an event.</p>
<p>Obscure and established, taproot and offshoot branch, the Winter Rockfest shines a broad spotlight. To represent that big tent, we asked several regular festivalgoers to pick one performance from the marathon that stuck with them. They&#8217;re accompanied by photos of still more performances, shot by roaming photographer John Rogers. Here&#8217;s what we took in at this year&#8217;s festival.</p>

<p>What is that secret age-old productivity tool? Music.<br />
Yep. The right music can help you stay focused and more productive. Here’s how:<br />
Music Helps Boost Productivity on Repetitive Tasks</p>
<p>Research has shown that when presented with repetitive tasks, music can help make those tasks more enjoyable and boost productivity. In this study, for instance, assembly line workers reported feeling happier and experiencing higher efficiency while listening to music.</p>
<p>Studies suggest that this is because music helps boost mood and therefore contributes to productivity. One study from Canadian researchers looked at this concept. What they found was that time-on-task was shorter — which means they got the work done quicker — and the quality of work performed was better when music was playing. Not only did those listening to music complete tasks faster, but they also came up with better, more creative ideas when the music was on.</p>
<p>This concept of mood can be further explained. Listening to music at your desk can help drown out other distracting noises like chatting coworkers, the buzz of the copy machine, and the clicks of other people typing around you. Placing earbuds in your ears to drown all that noise out — or even having music play over the office’s speakers — creates a more consistent and enjoyable environment that makes you feel more comfortable and relaxed in the space.<br />
The New York Times further suggests that melodic tunes promote the release of dopamine, a feel-good chemical in the brain, which also contributes to that good mood and promotes a more productive working environment.</p>
<p>All of this suggests that music may be a valuable tool in boosting efficiency when performing mundane tasks, such as data entry or answering emails. Some suggest that when trying to focus on a complex task, music can be distracting – just as a noisy office may distract workers. But that doesn’t mean all music is bad for creative tasks. It’s just that the same type of music may not be appropriate in both situations. In fact, studies show that moderate levels of ambient noise can boost creativity, so you have to be conscious of what type of music is playing, and select it based on the task at hand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The line-up for the industrial, EBM and synthpop festival E-tropolis in Turbinenhalle in Oberhausen, Ruhr, on March 28 is complete.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, people just happening to pass by the two-block campus during Public Practice sessions are at the best advantage to enjoy the notes in the air, mixing with the environment. “We organize it so that several musicians are playing concurrently, in different areas of the campus,” explains Ming Ng, director of Active Arts. “So, there is a ‘soundscape’ that is created as you walk from one musician to another.”</p>
<p>Like exhibits in a museum, the participating musicians are set up with signs next to them, explaining who they are and what they are doing. Once in a while, people will stop to listen or to ask the musicians a quick question, but some don’t quite know what to make of the situation. “One man tried to drop a dollar into my saxophone case,” Oto recalls with a laugh.</p>
<p><iframe width="900" height="506" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBAIXeXkQoA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Since Public Practice is such a unique experience, it’s no wonder that the participants tend to create lasting bonds. The relationships begin outdoors on the Music Center campus, when one musician might stroll up to another to sight-read through some duos. At the end of the project everyone takes part in a group dinner and discussion, and the relationships often extend far beyond that day. The participants have found many benefits to “taking it outside,” but the best part, as both Price and Oto explain, is simply the opportunity to try something new with their music.</p>
